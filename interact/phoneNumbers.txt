Get WABA Health Status
https://amped-express.interakt.ai/api/v17.0/YOUR_WABA_ID?fields=health_status
This document describes how to determine whether or not you can send messages successfully using a given API resource.

If you request the health_status field on any of these nodes, the API will return a summary of the messaging health of all the nodes involved in messaging requests if using the targeted node. This summary indicates if you will be able to use the API to send messages successfully, if you will have limited success due to some limitation on one or more nodes, or if you will be prevented from messaging entirely.

Messaging Health Status
When you attempt to send a message, multiple nodes are involved, including the app, the business portfolio that owns or has claimed it, a WABA, a business phone number, and a template (if sending a template message).

Each of these nodes can have one of the following health statuses assigned to the can_send_message property:

AVAILABLE: Indicates that the node meets all messaging requirements.
LIMITED: Indicates that the node meets messaging requirements, but has some limitations. If a given node has this value, additional info will be included.
BLOCKED: Indicates that the node does not meet one or more messaging requirements. If a given node has this value, the errors property will be included which describes the error and a possible solution.
Overall Status
The overall health status property (health_status.can_send_message) will be set as follows:

If one or more nodes is blocked, it will be set to BLOCKED.
If no nodes are blocked, but one or more nodes is limited, it will be set to LIMITED.
If all nodes are available, it will be set to AVAILABLE.
